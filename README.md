# Pikachu Bot
- This bot will give you a random designated pokemon which in return you can take care of your pokemon!
  In such ways as feeding it to increase health, but remember not to do the action twice or more at a close range of time.
- You can also use the pokemon you have got to fight other people's pokemon with a special power.

> [!NOTE]
> Your pokemon may change if the code gets restarted

## Code
- This code is on development and still has future codes. If you encounter this code with errors then my apologies.

### Example
- At first you need to invite the bot, let's say you have. This bot uses the prefix of "!". You can start by typing "!go" and send it.
